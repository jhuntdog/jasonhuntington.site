  <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
  <p class="lead">
    I launched this website to learn about web development and web programming technologies, including HTML5, Nodejs, Javascript, Windows Azure, and domain management. <br>
  </p>
  <p class="lead">
    Inspired by my brother's insight, I plan to chronicle my adventures and maybe provide some resources to others.

  <p class="lead muted">There is a ton of work to do before the site is complete, but I'm proud of what I've got so far and am glad for the experience.</p>
