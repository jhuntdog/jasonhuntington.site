## Docpad for static site generation

After a great deal of research and experimentation with web site generators, Docpad stood alone for it's power and flexibility. Additionally, a great documentation site and strong developer community made it easy to get started.

## Tools

This site uses the following tools:

- [DocPad](http://docpad.org/) - power, template compiliation, site generation, awesomeness
- [Bower](http://twitter.github.com/bower/) - resource management
- [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) - css scaffolding, responsive design
- [jquery](http://jquery.com/) - dom manipulation
- A plethora of [Docpad Plugins](http://docpad.org/docs/plugins) - for extra markup support, including coffee-script, eco, less


## Hosting on Windows Azure

Why? Because Azure offers a nice hosting package for websites. I think that you can host up to 10 websites for free. Also, I like a challenge.
